# Neural Network using NumPy

## Objective
To build a neural network class from scratch using NumPy and use it for Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## How to run this code?
There are three files created for this project:
1. `activations_functions.py`: This file has three activation functions and their derivatives.
2. `neural_network.py`: This file has a class called MyNN (short for My Neural Network) that allows user to initialize a NN, train it, test it and predict on test data.
3. `model.py`: This file actually imports the above two files, loads Titanic dataset, creates neural network, trains its, validates its and runs the model on test data to report test accuracy.

To run it on your machine:
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/StarRider/Neural-Network-using-NumPy.git`
2. Install libraries from `requirements.txt`
3. Go to the directory `Neural-Network-using-NumPy`
4. Run `model.py` using Python 3.10

Following these steps will help you to run a pretrained model. To train a fresh model open `model.py` and set `TRAIN=True`. Also feel free to change other configurations. Your trained model will be stored in the `trained_models` folder for your future use.
